    <h2>Video Transcript</h2>
    <p>In this video we have an instructor from freecodecamp.org giving the in and outs of how to make a video and put it in your work during a lab assignment.He would explain each step in detail and even hints to the fact that they slip one in on you every time to have you scratching your head because it isnt in any of the notes you have previously taken.then he finishes off by driving but if you didnt remember it its probably because you in fact have not yet covered it.</p>

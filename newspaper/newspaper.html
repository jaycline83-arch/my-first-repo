      <h2>The Epstein Files: Transparency Act Forces Release</h2>
      <p>
        In late 2025, Congress passed the <em>Epstein Files Transparency Act</em> with overwhelming bipartisan support.
        President Trump signed the bill, compelling the Department of Justice to release thousands of pages of records
        within 30 days. These files include civil and criminal case documents, emails, and communications spanning decades.
        Survivors and advocates argue that transparency is essential for accountability, while critics warn of privacy risks
        for individuals named in the files. Early batches revealed Epstein’s ties to political figures, celebrities, and
        business leaders, sparking renewed calls for reform.

      <h2>Oversight and Public Records: Privacy vs. Transparency</h2>
      <p>
        Louisiana Congressman Clay Higgins cast the lone “no” vote against releasing the files, citing concerns about
        exposing victims’ names. Legal experts note that while transparency is vital, redactions may be necessary to
        protect survivors. The debate underscores the tension between public accountability and safeguarding privacy.
        Independent audits, chain‑of‑custody logs, and disclosure standards remain critical to preventing corruption
        and ensuring equal application of the law.

      <h3>Trump Corruption: Investigations and Conflicts</h3>
      <p>
        The Department of Justice and FBI are investigating top Trump administration officials accused of interfering
        in criminal probes of political adversaries. Reports suggest directives to halt inquiries into figures like
        Adam Schiff and Letitia James. Meanwhile, Senator Schiff introduced legislation to block Trump from seeking
        a $230 million taxpayer payout, calling his presidency “defined by corruption.” Watchdogs highlight conflicts
        of interest, profiteering at Trump properties, and politicization of the DOJ.

      <h3>Celebrity Scandals: Power and Accountability</h3>
      <p>
        High‑profile figures such as Harvey Weinstein, R. Kelly, Russell Simmons, and Sean “Diddy” Combs have faced
        lawsuits or convictions for sexual misconduct. In 2025, Smokey Robinson was accused by multiple women of assault
        and workplace abuse. These cases illustrate how fame can shield perpetrators, while survivors struggle for justice.
        Advocates call for stronger industry oversight and survivor‑centered reforms.

      <h3>Survivor Voices: Centering Truth and Support</h3>
      <p>
        Survivors of Epstein and other abuse scandals emphasize the need for trauma‑informed practices in investigations.
        Confidential reporting channels, legal support, and survivor‑led advocacy groups are shaping reforms. Their voices
        remind the public that accountability is not only about exposing perpetrators but also about building systems that
        protect and empower victims.

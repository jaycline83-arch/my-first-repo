      <p>
        Mary Anning was a self-taught paleontologist whose discoveries in the early 1800s transformed our understanding of prehistoric life. Despite facing gender and class barriers, she unearthed some of the most important fossils of her time, including the first complete Ichthyosaur and Plesiosaur skeletons. Her work laid the foundation for evolutionary biology and helped legitimize the science of paleontology.
